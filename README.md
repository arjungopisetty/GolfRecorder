============

Arjun Gopisetty, Edward Kim, and Chris Hsiao

## Introduction  

This program records various statistics of golfers. This program was designed for the golf coach at Homestead High School, Gary Yoshida. This program provides a user-friendly GUI to input, change, and store data about a set of golfers. This program also saves the data entered in another file.

## System Requirements

[GolfRecorder] requires Java 6 or above to run.

## Features

This program offers a convenient way to save data about specific players or specific courses. Inside of the program, a GUI will provide an intuitive way to edit and store data, and view helpful statistics about the data. By entering multiple scores and a course, the round index can be calculated. 	 

## Instructions 

The program will be user friendly and not require much instruction. However, the basics are to use the table to enter and edit scores for multiple golfers, and receive the round indices and final average index for each player. There are buttons for entering new courses, adding new players and rounds to the table, and the save button. To open a previously saved table, navigate to the save file in the project directory and select it.
